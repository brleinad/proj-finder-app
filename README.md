Proj (project) Finder helps you find your next climbing project using the Mountain Project API.

Mountain Project already has an great map to find crags near you and a great route finder to find routes in certain states/countries.
But what if you're just looking for your next project, for individual quality routes around you. 
Usually this would mean going on the map and going from crag to crag or filtering routes by state/country, iterating through all the states/province/countries near you. So if you you are in a place with many crags around you or near a state/province/country border this becomes very tedious.

This is how proj finder is for. It suggests highly rated routes around your location.
